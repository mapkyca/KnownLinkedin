Linkedin Support for Known
==========================

This plugin provides LinkedIn syndication (POSSE) support for Known articles, status updates and images.

Released under GPLv2, see [[LICENCE.txt]]

Installation
------------

* Drop the LinkedIn folder into the IdnoPlugins folder of your Known installation.
* Log into Known and navigate to Site configuration > Plugins.
* Enable the LinkedIn plugin on the Plugins page.

This plugin no longer requires a third party OAuth2 library, instead it makes use of Known's internal webservices API.

Known issues
------------

* LinkedIn has stupidly conservative rate limits on their API, so you may only be able to syndicate a handful of posts to LinkedIn within a 24 hour period. Choose wisely.
